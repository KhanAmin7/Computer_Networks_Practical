# Networking Practical Demonstrations üåê

This GitHub repository contains a collection of hands-on networking practical demonstrations designed to enhance your understanding of network administration and configuration. These practicals cover a wide range of essential networking topics and tools, providing valuable insights into various aspects of network management.

## Practical Topics Covered üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Configuring SSH Protocol for Secure Communication:** Learn how to set up SSH for secure remote communication, ensuring encrypted, authenticated, and secure data transfer.

2. **Using Ping, Tracert / Traceroute, Ipconfig / Ifconfig, Route, and Arp Utilities:** Explore essential network diagnostic and troubleshooting tools, including `ping`, `tracert` (Windows) / `traceroute` (Linux), `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ifconfig` (Linux), `route`, and `arp`.

3. **Configuring Multiple Layer 2 Switches:** Set up a network with multiple Layer 2 switches and verify connectivity between computers connected to these switches.

4. **Creating a Wireless Network with Access Points:** Deploy access points to create a functional wireless network, connecting multiple devices for seamless wireless communication.

5. **Configuring IP Static Routing:** Configure static routes to control the flow of IP traffic and manage data routing between network segments.

6. **Configuring IP Routing Using RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Implement dynamic IP routing using RIP, enabling routers to exchange routing information efficiently.

7. **Configuring Simple OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Set up OSPF for dynamic routing, utilizing the link-state routing algorithm to determine the shortest path to destinations.

8. **Configuring DHCP Server and Client:** Establish a DHCP server to automate IP address assignment and configure DHCP clients to obtain IP addresses from the server.

9. **Configuring DNS, HTTP, DHCP Server and Client:** Configure DNS for domain name resolution, facilitate HTTP server-client communication, and integrate DHCP for streamlined IP management.
